#Texas-Hold-Em-Game
The program is the game Texas Hold 'Em. First an array of 52 cards are generated. The cards are then shuffled.
Then the first card is drawn for player one. Player two gets the second card, player 1 gets the third card, 
and player 2 gets the fourth card. Then 5 flop cards are chosen. The program then calculates the best 5-card poker hand 
from the 7 possible cards for each player. A winner is declared unless the game ends in a draw.
